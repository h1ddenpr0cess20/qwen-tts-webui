# AI Output Disclaimer and Conditions of Use

Effective date: 2026-01-30

This document explains the limits of responsibility for the Qwen3 TTS web app ("the App"). It is informational and not legal advice. It supplements, and does not replace, the MIT License and any terms included in this repository or user interface.

## 1) Purpose and Scope
- Clarifies that synthesized audio/video comes from models you run or configure.
- Allocates responsibility for use and consequences to you—not to the App author(s).
- Sets conditions of use. If you disagree, do not use the App.

## 2) Definitions
- "App": The Qwen3 TTS application and accompanying materials.
- "Models": AI models you load locally (e.g., Qwen3-TTS variants) or otherwise supply.
- "Outputs": Any WAV/MP3 audio or rendered video generated by the App.
- "You": Any user, administrator, or organization using or distributing the App.

## 3) Nature of the Service
- The App lets you prepare prompts and run text-to-speech with models you provide.
- You control which checkpoints you download and where you run them; the App does not host models or route traffic to third-party APIs.
- Any defects or harms attributable to model behavior are your responsibility.

## 4) No Responsibility for Model Outputs
- Outputs are generated by models not developed or operated by the App author(s).
- The App author(s) are not responsible for content, actions, or consequences arising from Outputs.
- If you disagree with this allocation of responsibility, do not use the App.

## 5) No Professional or Emergency Use
- Outputs are not a substitute for professional advice (medical, legal, financial, safety, etc.).
- Do not use the App or Outputs for crisis response, life-support, or any safety-critical context.

## 6) User Duties
- Review and verify Outputs before use; confirm pronunciations and factual claims.
- Comply with applicable laws and model licenses.
- Obtain consent before cloning or imitating real voices; avoid impersonation.
- Avoid putting sensitive or regulated data into prompts or saved profiles unless you accept the risk.

## 7) Examples of Risks (Non-Exhaustive)
- Mispronunciations or inaccurate narration that misleads listeners.
- Offensive or biased speech generated by the model.
- Impersonation or deepfake misuse of real people without consent.
- Copyright or publicity-rights issues when using synthesized voices in content.
- Privacy risk if you include sensitive material in prompts or uploaded reference audio.

## 8) Prohibited Uses
- Harassment, discrimination, or other harmful conduct.
- Impersonating individuals without their consent or violating publicity/privacy rights.
- Illegal activity or distribution of illegal content.

## 9) Allocation of Risk, Limitation of Liability, and Indemnification
- The App is provided “as is,” without warranties of any kind. Use is at your own risk.
- To the maximum extent permitted by law, the App author(s) disclaim all liability for any claim, loss, or damage arising from or related to Outputs or your use of the App.
- You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the App author(s), contributors, and maintainers from and against claims and costs arising out of your use, your prompts, your Outputs, or your violations of law or third-party rights.

## 10) Acceptance and Updates
- By using the App, you confirm that you have read and agree to this disclaimer.
- If you do not agree, you must not use the App.
- This document may be updated over time; continued use means you accept the latest version.
