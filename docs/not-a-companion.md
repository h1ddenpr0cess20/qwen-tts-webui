# Not a Companion — Please Read

Qwen3 TTS is a technical tool for generating speech from text. It is not meant to be a “companion,” “friend,” therapist, or romantic partner.

## Why this policy exists
- Clarity of purpose: This project focuses on speech synthesis, tooling, and learning — not simulated relationships.
- Boundaries matter: Models and voices are not people. Treating them as such creates expectations this project will not support.
- Product direction: Effort goes into accuracy, latency, and reliability, not features that emulate intimacy.

## If you were planning to use it as a companion
Take this as a firm nudge: please don’t. If you are crafting a romance persona or using voices to fill a social gap, pause and reach out to real people instead. Close the app, take a walk, call a friend or professional, join a community, or work on a project that helps you grow.

## Intended uses
- Voice prototyping for apps, videos, and accessibility demos
- Research, debugging, and model experimentation
- Content production with responsible review of outputs
- Local/private experimentation with your own models or checkpoints

## Not intended uses
- Companionship, romance, or simulated intimacy
- Emotional dependency or therapy replacement
- Any use that treats the model or voice as a person

Thank you for respecting the project’s boundaries and intent.
